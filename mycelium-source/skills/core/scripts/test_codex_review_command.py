"""Content-contract test for the shared codex-review skill (issue #60).

CI validates command frontmatter inline but does not run pytest, so this test is
both the TDD driver for the command and a regression guard. It pins the
behaviors issue #60 requires: address the specific Codex comment AND audit the
whole branch for other instances of the same error pattern, with a
Codex-access-gated `@codex review` re-trigger and a confirm-before-post reply.

The assertions are concept-level (keyword/substring), not exact prose, so the
command can be reworded freely as long as the required behaviors remain.
