# Review checklists

These files are loaded by the sub-agents dispatched from `/mycelium:review`.
The main skill (`skills/review/SKILL.md`) does NOT read them directly — it passes
the path to the appropriate sub-agent.

## Output contract for sub-agents

Each sub-agent must return findings in this shape (one block per finding):

```yaml
- severity: major | minor
  file: path/to/file.py
  line: 42  # or "42-58" for ranges; omit if N/A
  category: short tag from the agent's checklist (e.g. "leakage:preprocessing")
  summary: one sentence — what's wrong
  evidence: |
    1-5 lines copied VERBATIM from the source — enough that a reader sees
    the issue without opening the file. If the issue is a missing thing
    (no doublet detection, no multiple-comparison correction), show the
    surrounding lines and add a marker comment like `# (no FDR step here)`.
  why_it_matters: one or two sentences specific to this analysis context
  suggested_fix: what to do about it (one sentence is plenty)
  confidence: high | medium | low
  suggested_tripwire: missing-counts-file  # optional; see deep-tripwires.md
```

**Optional `suggested_tripwire` field.** If the finding is the kind of
silent failure that a behavioral tripwire could confirm — silent
fallback, missing-data handling, sample alignment, label leakage,
contrast direction, report-value freshness — tag it with the name of
the matching tripwire from `deep-tripwires.md`. Synthesis aggregates
these tags so the main skill can compose the Step 5 tripwire menu
without re-reasoning. If no tripwire fits, omit the field — do not
invent names.

**Severity is two levels only:**
- **`major`** — result is invalid, misleading, or insecure if not
  addressed (train/test contamination, look-ahead bias, hardcoded
  credentials, double dipping, hallucinated APIs, sample swap, missing
  multiple-comparison correction at scale, smuggled defaults on
  load-bearing knobs, BC cruft hiding the real code path, etc.)
- **`minor`** — would improve but doesn't change the conclusion (missing
  CIs alongside a clearly-significant estimate, hard-coded magic numbers,
  premature abstraction, comment freshness, naming clarity, etc.)

If the issue is purely stylistic and a linter would catch it, do not
include it. There's no separate Nit bucket — those just don't make it
into the output.

**`evidence` is the most important field after `summary`.** The synthesis
pass renders it as a code block under each finding so the user can see
what's wrong without opening the file. If you can't extract verbatim
lines, do not invent them — set evidence to `(unable to extract; see
file)` so the synthesis pass can flag it.

When a sub-agent considered a thing and decided to skip flagging it
(because evidence was weak, or it was already justified in
`.living/decisions.md`), include it in a separate `not_flagged` section
so synthesis can dedupe with other agents that may flag the same thing:

```yaml
not_flagged:
  - file: path/to/file.py
    line: 42
    considered: short description
    reason: why we decided not to flag (e.g. "documented in decisions.md as intentional")
```

## Decisions list

In addition to findings, each sub-agent should return a short list of
**consequential analytical decisions** visible in its scope — the choices
that, if changed, would meaningfully change the result. The synthesis
pass aggregates these into the report's "Key decisions in this analysis"
section. For each decision:

```yaml
decisions:
  - name: short label (e.g., "clustering resolution", "train/test split strategy")
    description: one-line description of the choice the analysis made
    finding_ref: F2  # if there's an associated finding; otherwise omit
```

Don't duplicate findings as decisions. The decisions list is independent
— it's a way to show the user every load-bearing choice in their work,
some of which are flagged and some of which the user just may want to
double-check.

## What every sub-agent should NOT flag

False positives kill review usefulness fast. Every checklist has a
"skip-flag" section. The shared rules across all agents:

- Don't flag stylistic preferences if a linter would catch them — let the
  linter do it
- Don't flag the same line twice with different framings; pick the most
  actionable
- Don't flag things explicitly justified in `.living/decisions.md` unless
  the justification is wrong
- Don't flag pre-existing code that the diff didn't touch, unless it
  directly affects the correctness of the touched code
- Don't speculate. If you cannot point to evidence in the diff or context
  files, omit the finding
- Don't generate "general best practice" reminders untethered from the
  specific code
