# Data Lineage

Per-session capture of analysis-script provenance: what scripts ran, against
which input files, producing which outputs — with SHA-256 snapshots taken **at
execution time** so iterative edit-run-edit-run loops don't lose history.

The subsystem is independent from the rest of mycelium's logging: it fires when
an analysis-script invocation is detected (`python`, `R`, `Rscript`, `jupyter`,
`uv run python`, `poetry run python`, `conda run … python`, including inline
`-c` / `-e`). Standard shell execution wrappers (`time`, `exec`, `nice`, and
`timeout`) may precede or nest around those interpreters. If static scanning
cannot resolve any file paths, the execution is retained as unresolved with an
explicit warning rather than dropped.

## Components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `skills/core/hooks/mycelium-data-tracker.sh` | PostToolUse:Bash. Per-Bash-call event capture. |
| `skills/core/hooks/mycelium-data-lineage-stop.sh` | Internal Stop phase. Consolidates cumulative events into a manifest before lifecycle enforcement. |
| `skills/core/hooks/mycelium-stop-check.sh` | Registered Stop command. Runs lineage consolidation synchronously, retains state when blocked, and rotates it after Stop is accepted. |
| `skills/core/scripts/extract_data_lineage_event.py` | Per-event extractor (called by tracker hook). |
| `skills/core/scripts/extract_data_lineage.py` | Manifest assembler (called by stop hook). |

Both hooks resolve their Python sibling via
`$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/../scripts/<file>.py`, so they
work from any install location without hardcoded paths. Env-var overrides
(`MYCELIUM_DATA_HELPER`, `MYCELIUM_DATA_EXTRACTOR`) are provided as escape
hatches for testing.

## On-disk layout

Per-session (`<sid>` = mycelium date-counter `YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`, or Claude Code
UUID fallback if mycelium hasn't recorded an active session):

```
.mycelium/
  mycelium-data-events.tmp                  # NDJSON, one event per detected script
  mycelium-data-events-prev/<sid>.tmp       # rotated on accepted Stop (20-file cap)
.living/
  log/
    data-lineage/<sid>.json                 # consolidated manifest
    .data-lineage-status-<sid>.json         # status sentinel (20-file cap)
```

The events tmp file is appended to under `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX)` from inside the
Python helper. Shell `>>` is only atomic up to `PIPE_BUF` (~4 KB on macOS),
and embedded script source can exceed that — concurrent Bash tools firing
PostToolUse hooks in parallel would otherwise interleave NDJSON lines.
If lifecycle enforcement blocks Stop, the marker and cumulative event file stay
in place; the next Stop attempt rebuilds the same session manifest with any
additional analysis events. Cleanup and raw-event rotation happen only after
the Stop check accepts the session.

## Event schema (NDJSON, one line per detected script)

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-05-26T15:32:11Z",
  "agent_id": null,
  "agent_type": null,
  "bash_cmd": "python analysis/foo.py",
  "bash_exit": null,
  "bash_wall_s": null,
  "script": "analysis/foo.py",
  "script_sha256": "ab12...",
  "script_source": "...",
  "git_sha": "c3d4...",
  "inputs":  [{"path", "sha256", "size_bytes", "n_rows"?}],
  "outputs": [{"path", "sha256", "size_bytes"}],
  "io_detection": "static",
  "lineage_warnings": [],
  "filters_detected": ["df.query(...)", ...],
  "seeds_detected": [42, ...]
}
```

`bash_exit` is populated when the host exposes a Bash exit code. Conditional
analysis commands are recorded only when the status or a statically known
prefix proves their AND/OR branch executed. Every component of a supported
pipeline is treated as executed, including a failed final analysis command.
Unquoted shell comments are removed before inference, while quoted and escaped
`#` characters remain part of arguments. Ambiguous textual matches are skipped
rather than asserted as provenance. Compound shell commands, heredocs, and
interpreter tokens outside a supported command position are omitted because the
hook does not receive a per-command execution trace. `bash_wall_s` remains
reserved for future host support. The post-action reminder hook uses the same
execution check so skipped, commented, or merely quoted analysis text does not
open a false lifecycle cycle.

Interpreter, flag, script, and notebook arguments are decoded as shell words,
including adjacent quoted, bare, and backslash-escaped components such as
`"analysis script".py` and `'analysis'\ script.py`.

A `python a.py && python b.py` chain emits **two** events (one per detected
script). Inline `-c` scripts emit one event each; their `script` field is
`null`, with the source embedded under `script_source` and identified by
`script_sha256`.

For dynamic `Path`/dictionary composition, a conservative repository fallback
may recover a uniquely named existing file. Candidates must data-flow into the
path argument of a recognized reader or writer, reader aliases must come from
an actual supported import and remain unshadowed, and direction comes from that
call rather than the file's directory. Expressions that choose among runtime
branches or concatenate an unresolved operand remain unresolved; fully static
string concatenation remains eligible. Directly resolved paths bypass the
fallback entirely. Dynamic searches exclude runtime/vendor trees and stop at a
fixed entry bound; ambiguity or a bound hit remains unresolved rather than
guessing.

When I/O is delegated through imports or no safe candidate can be recovered,
the event uses `"io_detection": "unresolved"`, leaves `inputs` and `outputs`
empty, and adds a `lineage_warnings` entry. Stop-time consolidation promotes
that warning to the manifest's `extraction_warnings` list. This preserves
evidence that the script ran without implying that its lineage was fully
captured.

## Manifest schema (consolidated at Stop)

```json
{
  "session_id": "2026-05-26-099",
  "repo_root": "/path/to/repo",
  "git_sha": "c3d4...",
  "started_at": "2026-05-26T15:32:11Z",
  "ended_at":   "2026-05-26T15:48:02Z",
  "n_actions": 7,
  "agents_seen": ["main", "<subagent-id>", ...],
  "actions": [<event 1>, <event 2>, ...],
  "summary": {
    "unique_inputs":  [{"path", "sha256"}, ...],
    "unique_outputs": [{"path", "sha256"}, ...],
    "total_wall_seconds": 0,
    "scripts_executed": ["analysis/foo.py", "(inline ab12cd34ef56)", ...]
  },
  "extraction_warnings": [...]
}
```

`scripts_executed` uses the script path when present, falling back to
`(inline <sha-prefix>)` so inline-only sessions still produce a populated
list. Repeated invocations of the same inline source collapse to one entry.

## Detection coverage

**Analysis invocation patterns detected** (matched anywhere in the command):
- `python` / `python3` (script path or `-c` inline)
- `Rscript` (script path)
- `R … -e "…"` (inline)
- `jupyter nbconvert|execute notebook.ipynb`
- `conda run … python …`
- `uv run … python …`
- `poetry run … python …`
- `time`, `exec`, `nice`, and `timeout` before or nested around any supported
  interpreter invocation

**Data I/O patterns scanned in the script body** (case-sensitive Python idioms):
- Reads: `pd.read_{parquet,csv,tsv,feather,hdf,h5,json,excel,stata,sas,orc,pickle,table}`, `ad.read_h5ad`, `ad.read_csv`, `np.load`, `xr.open_{dataset,dataarray,zarr,mfdataset}`, `sc.read{,_h5ad,_csv,_mtx,_10x_h5,_10x_mtx}`
- Writes: `.to_{parquet,csv,tsv,feather,hdf,h5,json,excel,stata,sas,orc,pickle,table}`, `.write_{csv,parquet,json,h5ad}`, `np.save{,_compressed,z}`, `(plt|fig|ax).savefig`, `.to_netcdf`
- Filters: `.query(…)`, `.sample(…)`, `.filter(…)`, boolean masks (`df[df.col > x]` / `df[df['col'] != '']`), `.loc[…]` / `.iloc[…]`, `.merge(…)`, `.join(…)`, `pd.concat(…)`
- Seeds: `np.random.seed(N)`, `random.seed(N)`, `torch.manual_seed(N)`, `np.random.default_rng(N)`

**Not statically resolved (recorded as warnings)**:
- R-side I/O (only R *invocation* is detected, not its inputs/outputs)
- Generic `open(path)` reads — false-positive risk too high
- Dynamic paths (`pd.read_csv(some_var)`) — only string literals are captured

## Limits

- Script source larger than 100 KB is referenced by SHA but not embedded
- Files larger than 100 MB get path + size only, no SHA
- `bash_exit` is populated when the host exposes it; otherwise conditional
  branches without independent execution evidence are omitted conservatively
- `bash_wall_s` remains `null` until a host exposes reliable wall time

## Installation

`init_repo.install_claude_hooks()` registers the tracker and the coordinating
Stop hook. The lineage consolidation script is invoked synchronously from that
coordinator rather than registered as a sibling. Existing Mycelium repositories
are upgraded by `migrate_existing_repos.py`; the migration removes the old
standalone registration and refreshes the coordinator path atomically.

## Extending the regex pack

Both hooks deliberately use plain regex (not AST) so they can scan inline
`-c` snippets without parsing. Adding a new I/O pattern:

1. Add a `re.compile(...)` to the relevant list in `extract_data_lineage_event.py`
   (`INPUT_REGEXES`, `OUTPUT_REGEXES`, `FILTER_REGEXES`, or `SEED_REGEXES`).
2. Add a test case to `test_extract_data_lineage_event.py`.
3. Run `python3 -m pytest skills/core/scripts/test_extract_data_lineage_event.py -v`.

Capture group 1 of each regex is treated as the matched path/expression.
