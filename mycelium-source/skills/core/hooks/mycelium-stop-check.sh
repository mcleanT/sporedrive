# mycelium-stop-check.sh — Claude Code Stop hook
# 1. Auto-finalizes session log in .living/log/ (factual record, guaranteed)
# 2. Blocks session end if meaningful work was performed but .living/
#    learnings/decisions were not updated (enforces reflection)
# Does NOT block read-only or config-only sessions.
#
# Install: Add to .claude/settings.local.json under "Stop" hooks
# Input: JSON on stdin with session metadata
# Output: JSON with {"decision": "block", "reason": "..."} to prevent stop if needed
