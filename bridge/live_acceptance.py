"""REAL-runtime acceptance for the hardened codex-claude bridge (WFI-M3-HARDEN).

Run only from a cmux-descended process, and only by the human/lead operator: it creates a
disposable Claude Code session in a scratch git worktree on a NEW, unfocused terminal surface,
drives it through `cmux_bridge.core.Bridge` (observe/bind/submit/wait/compact/release) and writes
receipts.

Safety invariants enforced here, not merely documented:

* only surfaces this run created are ever written to or closed. Every created surface UUID is
  resolved EXACTLY from the `surface:N` ref returned by `new-surface` (never a set difference) and
  appended to <out>/owned-surfaces.json before anything else can fail;
* the source under test must be frozen (`git status --porcelain` empty) unless ALLOW_DIRTY=1;
* a case that could not run is recorded with pass=false and note "not run: <why>". Nothing
  unsupported, skipped or errored is ever recorded as a pass.

Every case is labelled `real`, `real+injected` (real transport, injected/simulated fault) or
`state-manipulated`.

Usage:
  python3 bridge/live_acceptance.py --workspace <WORKSPACE-UUID> --scratch <dir> --out <dir> \
      [--model claude-sonnet-5] [--state-dir <dir>]

    BOTH the tool input and the tool-result metadata — matched foreground results ALONE never prove

          - it is a ``Bash`` whose command trails a single ``&`` (shell-level backgrounding, which

          - it is a ``Task`` or ``Agent`` subagent spawn (async; a subagent's completion is not

        The footer agent hint and an Agent/Workflow-disallowed launch flag are NOT sufficient
